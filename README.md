## Summary

-	As the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact, Pewlett Hackard will need to fill 90,398 roles. 

-	There are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. However, since only two managers are nearing retirement it may be possible for managers to help train the incoming employees.

When compared to the number of employees retiring by title 

![retiring_titles.png](https://github.com/Emmagrace878/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Analysis_Projects_Folder/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis_Folder/Data/retiring_titles.png)

it becomes clear that there is a deficit. There are no managers eligible for mentorship and each senior engineer would have to mentor seventy new employees. 

## Employee Gender balance 
The total number of current employees skews male.

For the first seven years of hiring at the company (from 1985-1992) hiring was skewed towards male employees. 60% of new hires were male and 40% were female.

From 1993-2000, this trend held steady with 60% of new hires being male and 40% female.

The balance of male and female employees is something the company may want to consider as a large round of new hiring begins.
